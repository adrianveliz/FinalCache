Raw data used for Adrian Veliz's Disseratation. The data was obtained with the help of Aleksandr Diamond and was gnerated using Firefox.
This run generated half a GB of data and exceeded GitHub's maximum individual file upload limit. As such, it was spilt into several different 50 MB files.
Please recombine sequentially once downloaded to be able to verify the results of the disseration, or feel free to generate your own test (see ../Tools). 

Note that the simulation expects the fire_logs directory to contain just the test file so be sure to delete this file an the uncombined data files before running.
