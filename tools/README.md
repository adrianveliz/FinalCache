These are the scripts used to generate and filter the data generated by Firefox. The data used to create the intial published graphs and analysis for the exploratory research is located under ../fire_logs.

The shell scripts were were written for linux bash and the Python is version 2.x (though migrating to 3.x should be trivial).

fire_log.sh clears Firefox's cache, configures with a limited size, and disables smartsize. Be sure to save any existing logs before running this script.
